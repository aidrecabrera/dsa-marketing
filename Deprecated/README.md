# Project Aneta  

Project Aneta is a crucial initiative aimed at improving financial management in government procurement projects, particularly for DSA Marketing, Inc. The current manual handling of financial documents is both inefficient and error-prone, potentially leading to project delays and compliance issues. This project seeks to address these challenges by developing a Government Procurement Financial Management System (GPFMS) tailored to DSA Marketing, Inc.'s needs. The involvement of procurement bidders, like DSA Marketing, Inc., is highlighted as essential in ensuring compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, promoting transparency, and adhering to international standards. This system will streamline financial processes and enhance efficiency.
